<h1>Celebrating 50 Panda-mazing Years</h1>
<h2>An Evening with Giant Panda Experts</h2>

On Thursday, April 21, meet the people behind the pandas!

<p>In this panel-format program, you'll hear what it takes study, raise and care for giant pandas â€” directly from scientists, veterinarians and keepers who follow these amazing animals from the womb to the wild. It's a once-in-50-year look behind the scenes of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute's world-class giant panda conservation program.

Snacks and drinks will be available for purchase from 6 p.m. until 7:30 p.m., but please note that only clear liquids may be brought into the theater.

This paid, ticketed program is best suited for ages 15+.</p>
